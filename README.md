# What is Nmap and How to Use It?

## üîç What is Nmap?

**Nmap (Network Mapper)** is a free and open-source network scanning tool. It is widely used by system administrators and cybersecurity professionals to:

- Discover devices on a network (host discovery)  
- Detect open ports (port scanning)  
- Identify running services and versions (service/version detection)  
- Gather operating system information (OS detection)  
- Perform vulnerability assessments

Nmap ranges from being a simple IP scanner to a powerful tool for in-depth security auditing.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use Nmap?

Nmap is typically used via the command line. Basic syntax:

```
nmap [options] <target IP or domain>
```
